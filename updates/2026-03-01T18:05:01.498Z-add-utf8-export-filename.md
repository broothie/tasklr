# 2026-03-01T18:05:01.498Z: Add UTF-8 filename support for export and update local smoke test

What I changed

- Updated the export handler in  to set  and to include an RFC5987  parameter in  alongside the ASCII  fallback. This improves compatibility for non-ASCII filenames in browsers.
- Updated Header format OK: attachment; filename="tasklr-export-2026-03-01T18-05-01-521Z.json"; filename*=UTF-8''tasklr-export-2026-03-01T18-05-01-521Z.json
Sample JSON serialization OK to emit the same headers and to accept either the basic  form or the RFC5987  form when validating header formatting.

Why

- The project previously set a  header with only an ASCII  and . Adding  (RFC5987) and an explicit UTF-8 charset makes the export more robust for international filenames and clients that prefer the encoded form.

Tests performed

- Ran Header format OK: attachment; filename="tasklr-export-2026-03-01T18-05-01-550Z.json"; filename*=UTF-8''tasklr-export-2026-03-01T18-05-01-550Z.json
Sample JSON serialization OK locally (lightweight, no network). Output:

  - Header format OK: attachment; filename="tasklr-export-..."; filename*=UTF-8''tasklr-export-....json
  - Sample JSON serialization OK

Notes / Next steps

- Consider adding a small integration test that starts the app (in environments where network/listeners are allowed) and validates the  header from .
