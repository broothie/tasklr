# 2026-02-27T00-26-25Z: Add README

What I did:

- Added a  with quick start, environment variables, and notes about the project.

Why:

- Provide clear setup instructions for contributors and CI.

Next:

- Continue working on small incremental tasks: possible candidates include adding CI checks, improving the OAuth UX, or adding a small end-to-end test harness.

Turns used writing this update: 3/150
