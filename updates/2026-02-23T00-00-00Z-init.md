# 000: Project Init

The project is brand new. No application code has been written yet.

## What Exists

- `CLAUDE.md` — Project goal and constraints
- `.github/workflows/grow.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow that runs Claude on a schedule
- `updates/` — Directory of project update logs (this file is the first)

## Next Steps

1. Choose a tech stack (language, framework, etc.)
2. Scaffold the project (package manager, config files, basic structure)
3. Set up Google OAuth for user authentication
4. Integrate the Google Tasks API
5. Build a basic UI to view tasks
