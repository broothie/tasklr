# 2026-03-01T15:04:51.315Z: Run local smoke export test and commit results

What I changed

- Executed the lightweight local smoke-style export test script at scripts/smoke_export_local_test.js which verifies Content-Disposition header formatting and JSON serializability without opening network sockets.
- Created this update note documenting the test run and results.

Why

- The project includes a full smoke test (scripts/smoke_export_test.js) which requires starting the app and network listeners; that is not allowed in this environment. The local unit-style smoke test provides a safe, fast verification of the export formatting behavior.

Tests performed

- Ran node scripts/smoke_export_local_test.js and observed the following output (captured):


Header format OK: attachment; filename="tasklr-export-2026-03-01T15-04-06-274Z.json"
Sample JSON serialization OK
(node:3081) Warning: The 'NO_COLOR' env is ignored due to the 'FORCE_COLOR' env being set.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)


Notes / Next steps

- In CI or development where installing dependencies and starting network listeners is permitted, run npm ci && npm run smoke-export to run the full server-based smoke test.
- Consider adding this lightweight test to CI as a quick fast-check step.

Turn accounting

- Turn when started: 3
